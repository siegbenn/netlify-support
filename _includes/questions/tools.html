<h2 class="{{site.question_style}}">Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.  Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.</h2>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>I used Jekyll to generate my site. I chose Jekyll because I didn't want my site to be a blog and it's the simplest of the bunch to configure. Because vanilla HTML is valid, it was really easy to scaffold the layout. For styling, I chose Tachyons. It's a simple style sheet that I've been working with lately. I think it has a very unintrusive style and is easy to use.
<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>For the redirect bonus question, I didn't know that the _redirects file needed to be inside of the build directory. Once I realized that, fixing it was easy.
